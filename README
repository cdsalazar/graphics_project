Future City

CSCI4229/5229 Fall 2014

I did not get as much time as I thought I would to work on this assignment over
Thanksgiving. As a result, the textures and lighting is still very lacking. I
still need to apply textures to most of the scene, and I did not have a chance
to create as many objects as I thought I would.

The current light source is temporary to show that the surface normals are good.
In the future, the lamps and stoplights will be the sources of light for the
scene.
Although, I think the main work the remains to be done is the texturing.

To run:
  $ make clean
  $ make
  $ ./city
